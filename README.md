The AirBnB Clone project marks the first step in building a full-stack web application. The goal is to implement a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This command interpreter is the backbone of subsequent development stages, including database management, API integration, and front-end development. Manages initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances
The command interpreter is the core feature of this project, enabling seamless interaction with AirBnB objects. It is like a simplified shell, tailored to handle specific operations for managing AirBnB data.
To start the command interpreter, Clone the Repository, Make the Script Executable and Run the Command Interpreter.
To use the command interpreter, you can use the interactive and the non interactive mode.
